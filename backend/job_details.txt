 In this role, you can expect to:
 
  Troubleshoot technical issues and support SAP B1 users in day-to-day operations.

 At Butternut, we put the food back into dog food. We believe dogs deserve to eat the healthiest, most natural and tastiest food with none of the nasties. That's why we make freshly prepared dog food. Cooked like you would at home. Delivered in perfect portions. #LI-Hybrid
 As a B-Corp certified company; you can be sure you are joining a sustainable company who care about our people, product and our impact on the environment.
 Our goal is to help dogs live healthier, happier and longer lives whilst leaving humans smiling after every interaction. We've come a long way since our co-founders (Kev & Dave) hand-delivered the first Butternut Box, we now feed a lot of dogs across the UK & Europe - but we want to feed dogs everywhere. And to do this, we need a team of brilliant people who share that ambition to come and work with us.
